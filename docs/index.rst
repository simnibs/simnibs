SimNIBS 
=======


**SimNIBS** is a free and open source software package for the Simulation of Non-invasive Brain Stimulation. It allows for realistic calculations of the electric field induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electric stimulation (TES).

A SimNIBS workflow consists of three main parts:
   * :ref:`Generate high-quality head models <head_modeling_tutorial>` from MR images
   * Set up and run simulation in the :ref:`graphical user interface <gui_tutorial>`, :ref:`MATLAB or Python<scripting_tutorial>`
   * :ref:`Visualize simulation results <visualization_tutorial>`, and transform them to *FsAverage* or *MNI* space.
